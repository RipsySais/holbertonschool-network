# OSI Model

## 1. What is the OSI model?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a **conceptual model** that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system **without regard to the underlying internal structure and technology**.  
It helps to **understand and standardize how different network protocols and hardware interact**.

## 2. How is the OSI model organized?
The OSI model is organized **from the lowest layer to the highest layer**:  

1. **Physical Layer** – Transmission of raw bit streams over a physical medium (electrical signals, light, radio).  
2. **Data Link Layer** – Reliable node-to-node data transfer, error detection and correction.  
3. **Network Layer** – Routing of packets (IP, ICMP).  
4. **Transport Layer** – End-to-end communication (TCP, UDP).  
5. **Session Layer** – Managing sessions and connections between applications.  
6. **Presentation Layer** – Data translation, encryption, and compression.  
7. **Application Layer** – Interfaces for applications to use network services (HTTP, SNMP, SMTP, etc).
